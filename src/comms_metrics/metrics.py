Created on Fri Feb  5 08:21:30 2021

This module provides different metrics to
evaluate the overall communication for a given
power distribution system. We want to know how
well meters can communicate with each other.

For our analysis, we care about how far away meters
are from each other. We have developed different metrics
that capture things like how many meters are near a
central meter, how many meters are isolated, what is the
largest radius to envelope all meters in one circle, etc.

This module allows for performing this analysis on a
single model or multiple models. It has the ability to
save these results for further analysis.

This module can be expanded to include more metrics
and/or plotting results.

    This class provides all the metrics for evaluating the
    overall communication abilities of a power distribution
    system. More information for each metric is provided
    in the documentation string of each function.

    Args:
        dataframe (pandas dataframe) - This is a pandas
        representation of the power distribution system
        model. It contains information like the name of the
        feeder, the names of the meters, and the meters'
        locations.

        meters (list) - List of the meters in a given
        power distribution system.

        pos_x (str) - The 'x' position of the meters'
        locations. For example, this might be the longitude
        value of a coordinate. This should be a column in
        the dataframe.

        pos_y (str) - The 'y' position of the meters'
        locations. For example, this might be the latitude
        value of a coordinate. This should be a column in
        the dataframe.

        unit (str) - The unit of measurement the positional
        information is currently in. For example, the GLD
        positional data is in 'feet', while the Santa Fe data
        is latitude-longitude pairs. This should be 'feet' or
        'geo', otherwise there will be an error.

    Returns:
        EvaluateSystem (obj) - An object that represents the
        MeterNetwork object of the power distribution model.
        This is the object that can be used for metric
        function calls.

                that there are few isolated meters, we take 1 minus
                the weighted value. Thus, our weighted isolated meter
                count value is as follows:
                    iso = 1 - ((sum(counts) / len(counts)) / total_meters)

            Densities:
                For our analysis, we want as many meters near
                each other as possible. This will show that
                the meters can communicate well with each other.

                To get the weighted density count, we find the
                average of all the density counts. Then, we divide
                that value by the total number of meters minus 1.
                The best case is that the average of the density
                counts is equal to the total number of meters
                minus 1. That would mean our model is highly
                dense. The worst case would be the average is
                0, which would say that our model is not dense
                at all. So, our weighted density count values
                is as follows:
                    dens = (sum(counts) / len(counts)) / total_meters - 1

                2021-03-23: Dividing by maximum density value instead;
                will come back to this when we get more mony.

            Ranges:
                For our analysis, we need to know what the ranges
                for different meters as the center are. This will
                inform us how spread out the meters are from
                each other. For now, an extremely large range value
                is considered as based. However, it is important
                to note that it is quite possible that meters for
                a single feeder are spread out from each other in
                the real world.

                To get a weighted range value, we find the
                average of all the ranges. Then, we divide that
                value by the maximum range. The worse case is that
                the average is equal to the maximum. This tells
                us that the meters are very spread out from each
                other. The best case is that the average is very
                low compared to the maximum. To turn this value
                into a positive value to show that the meters
                aren't spread out from each other, we take 1 minus
                that weighted value. Thus, our weighted range value
                is as follows:
                    range = 1 - ((sum(ranges) / len(ranges)) / max(ranges))

            Continuous:
                For our analysis, we want to know if any two
                meters can communicate to each other, whether
                that is diretly or indirectly.

                To get a weighted continuity score, we find the
                average of the continuity scores. The best case
                is that the average continuity score would be
                equal to 1. That would tell us that all meters
                can communicate to each other, either directly
                or indirectly. The worst case would be that the
                average is equal to 0. That would tell us that
                all the meters cannot communicate to each other,
                either directly or indirectly. So, the weighted
                continuity score is as follows:
                    cont = sum(counts) / len(counts)

            Single Hop Counts:
                For our analysis, we need to know how many
                meters have a certain number of meters nearby.
                This is a form of density calculations. This
                will tell us, in a way, how many options are
                available for meters to communicate with other
                meters.

                To get a weighted single hop count score, we
                find the average of all single hop counts. Then,
                we divide by the total number of meters. The
                best case is when the average is equal to the
                total number of meters. In a similar vain, this
                tells us that our model is highly dense. The worst
                case is when the average is very low. So, our
                weighted single hop count value is as follows:
                    shc = (sum(counts) / len(counts)) / total_meters

            Island Counts:
                For our analysis, we need to know how many
                islands of meters exist if communication beyond
                a certain radius is removed.

                To get a weighted island count score, we find
                the average of all the island counts. Then, we
                divide by the total number of meters. The best
                case is when the average is equal to 1; this
                tells us that all the meters can still communicate
                with each other. The worse case is when the
                average is equal to the total number of meters.
                That tells us that the meters cannot communicate
                with each other beyond a certain radius, which
                is similar to the isolated meter count. So, our
                weighted island count value is as follows:
                    island = 1 - (sum(islands) / len(islands)) / total_meters

            Final Score:
                This is the overall score of a power distribution
                model. This score tells us how well the meters
                in the model can communicate with each other. The
                higher the score, the better the meters can
                communicate with each other.

                The score value is as follows:
                    score = (0.2 * (dens + iso + cont + shc))\
                        + (0.1 * (range + island))

        Args:
            radii (list or array) - List or array of radii for
            performing the metrics.

        Returns:
            score (float) - The weighted score of all the metrics
            for all meters for all radii. It is represented as a
            percent.

        To compare the modelled data to the real data, we
        calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the
        two datasets. First, we capture the bar heights of
        the histogram representatiom of the single hops
        per radius. Then, we normalize the bar heights so
        that the modelled and real data are on the same scale.
        Lastly, we use scikit-learn's mean_squared_error
        function to get the MSE.

            dataframes) for comparing to real data.

            model is representing/coming from

            demographic (str) - Whether the model(s) represent(s)
            an urban, suburban, and/or a rural feeder.

            how (str) - How we should compare the models to the real
            data. The options are as follows:
                'agg' - Choosing how='agg' will compare the model(s)
                to the real data as a whole, meaning we will compare
                the model(s) to ALL of the feeders at once in a
                particular region and demographic.

                'single' - Choosing how='single' will compare the
                model(s) to the real data individually, meaning we will
                compare the model(s) to EACH of the feeders, one at a
                time, in a particular region and demographic

            radii (list) - List of radii (in feet) to count the
            number of meters near a given meter.

        Returns:
            stats_df (pandas dataframe) - A pandas dataframe that
            contains the results of calucalting the MSE. If how
            equals 'agg', then the dataframe will have the scores
            based off of comparing the model(s) to the WHOLE real

## MATPOWER ##

MATPOWER is a package of MATLAB M-files for solving power flow and optimal power flow problems. To download the package in its latest version or previous ones follow this [link][link2MATPOWER]. The main documentation can be found [here][link2MATPOWERMan] [1], while a short description of its functionality is presented in this [paper][link2MATPOWERpaper] [2].

The main 3 steps of running a MATPOWER simulation are:
<ol>
  <li>Preparing the input data file known as the case file, which defines all the parameters relevant to the power system in question and the purpose of the problem;</li>
  <li>Invoking the appropriate function to solve the problem;</li>
  <li>Accessing, saving to output files or plotting the simulation results.</li>
</ol>

## MATPOWER case files ##

MATPOWER case files are MATLAB functions (``.m`` files) that specify a set of data matrices corresponding to each component of the studied power system, that is, buses, generators, lines/branches, etc. All these matrices are bundled in a MATLAB structure, referred to as a **M**AT**P**OWER **C**ase (MPC). For example, the 9-bus, 3-generator power system model is specified as:
```
function mpc = case9
% CASE9    Power flow data for 9 bus, 3 generator case.
%   Please see CASEFORMAT for details on the case file format.
%
%   Based on data from Joe H. Chow's book, p. 70.

To facilitate the integration of MATPOWER within the FNCS environment, and its connection with distribution-side models, several additions have to be made to the case files to augment the MPC structure, that is:
<ol>
  <li>add vectors that specify the dimensions of each matrix in the MPC structure, defining every element of the power system; this helps with easily allocating the correct amount of memory in the C++ wrapper;</li>
  <li>add a FNCS communication interface that would facilitate the connection between the transmission simulator and the distribution simulator (GridLAB-D); at this stage, the following features are available:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>the total number of load buses where distribution sites are going to be connected to and their identification number;</li>
      <li>the total number of distribution sites that are getting attached to the transmission network, their id and the bus id where they are connected; keep in mind that multiple distribution sites could be connected to the same bus, and their power consumption is going to be aggregated;</li>
      <li>the total number and the id of the offline generators came in as part of creating scenarios that could affect increases in energy prices due to losing generation; they are application specific, so they could be left out;</li>
      <li>the amplification factor is meant to adjust the power consumption at the distribution level to an increased value, such that it makes a difference at the transmission level; if the distribution models provide enough load, then this factor could be set to 1.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>

The added MATLAB code line are shown below:
